## Marcus Bullock

I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for all things tech-related, and I have a background in music and foreign languages! After a five year career in the corporate consultancy sector, I decided to leave a secure and well paid job to pursue my passion and be able to love what I do. Initially, I am looking for roles as a junior developer at a tech company that prides itself on software development best-practice and can help me build on what I have already achieved.

## Skills

#### Consultancy

During my five year career at a high-end business consultancy, I worked on a team that advised clients on high-risk business engagements all over the world, as well as on cyber security best practice (where I discovered my love of programming). I prided myself on my ability to work with absolutely anyone, and on my drive to constantly improve and come out of my comfort zone. I also developed an analytical/problem-solving approach to the way I work.

- After distinguishing myself as a junior analyst, I was promoted to a senior analyst position within a year.
- I worked on 2 - 3 client engagements per week for FTSE 100 companies and high net worth individuals over a period of five years, indicating my drive and ability to work well within a team.
- I worked across multiple practices at the company in a wide range of sectors and geographies, indicating my versatility and eagerness to venture into new territory.
- During my time in the cyber security practice, the division grew from a side-project into the highest revenue-earning department at the company.
- High experience in corporate/client engagements and project delivery.

#### Software/web development

Although my career in web development has just begun, I have a solid foundation already in both front and back-end development. Thanks to my time at Europe's leading tech bootcamp, I work according to industry best practice, for example in concepts like Agile, BDD and TDD. My drive and eagerness to keep learning will be my core strengths in allowing me to succeed in this sector. I have found a passion in programming that I have felt in no other environment before!

- I love test driven development and how it prompts robust code.
- In a similar manner, I love how Agile promotes adaptive code, ready for continuous improvement.
- Within 12 weeks of learning web development, me and a three-man team managed to build an Uber-style tour-guide web-app in 2 weeks.
